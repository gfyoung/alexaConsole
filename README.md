# alexaConsole

Google Chrome extension for (un)hiding unnecessary Alexa skill entries.

# Motivation

At the time of creation, Amazon does not support deleting skills in the
following conditions:

* The skill was published, and afterwards
* The skill was suppressed and removed from publication

If the skill is no longer public, it seems intuitive that it can be deleted,
but for some reason, that is not the case.

# Publication

This extension is a little hacky admittedly and does not have the best of UI.
Thus, I have chosen to not publish this to the Chrome store until (if at all),
this skill reaches a state that I find is acceptable.

If you would like to install this extension for your own use, please refer
to the following StackOverflow post below:

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24577024/install-chrome-extension-not-in-the-store

Essentially, navigate to `chrome://extensions` in your browser and install an
"unpacked extension" using the `src` directory.
